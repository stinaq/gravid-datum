# AGENTS.md

Entry point for AI agents (and humans) working in this repo. Read all of it before writing code.

## Purpose

A small web app

## Where things are defined

| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | **How** the code is structured: layers, folders, rules, conventions, testing           | the structure or a rule changes |
| [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md)         | **What** the app does: features, inputs, outputs, domain formulas, acceptance criteria | behavior changes                |
| [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md)             | How it **looks**: feeling, tokens, key elements                                        | the visual design changes       |

Keep them separate. Architecture docs never describe specific features, feature docs never
prescribe structure (they may name the core module a feature lives in), and design docs only
cover the visual layer.

## Workflow for agents

1. Find the feature in `docs/FEATURES.md`. If it is not there, stop and ask. Do not invent features.
2. Implement it following `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. If a rule gets in the way, stop and ask.
   Don't work around it.
3. Pure logic first, with tests. Then the hook. Then dumb components and the wiring in `App.tsx`.
4. If behavior changed, update `docs/FEATURES.md` in the same change. If structure changed,
   update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
5. Never invent real-world data (car consumption, prices). Ask the project owner.

## Definition of done

1. `npm run lint` passes (including layer rules)
2. `npm run test` passes, and new core logic has tests
3. `npm run build` passes (type check included)
4. No logic was added to `components/` or `App.tsx`
5. Docs updated if behavior or structure changed
